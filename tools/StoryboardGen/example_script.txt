FADE IN:

EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

Rain pours down on the dimly lit street. Neon signs reflect in puddles, creating a kaleidoscope of colors. ALEX (30s, disheveled) hurries along the sidewalk, collar turned up against the rain.

ALEX stops suddenly, noticing something across the street. A shadowy FIGURE stands in a doorway, watching. Their eyes meet briefly before the FIGURE retreats into the darkness.

ALEX
(muttering)
Not again...

ALEX continues walking, faster now, glancing nervously over their shoulder. The street is empty behind them, but the feeling of being watched persists.

ALEX reaches an apartment building and quickly punches in a door code. As the door opens, ALEX looks back one more time. The FIGURE is now standing under a streetlight, clearly visible.

ALEX hurries inside, the door closing automatically behind them.

INT. APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT

ALEX leans against the wall, breathing heavily. Pulls out a phone and dials.

ALEX
It's me. They're back.
