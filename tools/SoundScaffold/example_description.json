  "description": "A small group of hikers sit around a crackling campfire in a dense forest at dusk. Occasional owl hoots and distant wolf howls can be heard. The wind rustles through the leaves creating a gentle backdrop of sound. One hiker is softly playing a guitar while others talk in hushed tones. The fire pops and snaps as new wood is added. In the far distance, there's the faint sound of a small stream or creek.",
